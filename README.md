# Web-BAMT
Online tool for Bayesian Networks <br>
Frontend: TypeScript <br>
Backend: Python, SQLite <br>

# The main concept
Developing [BAMT](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/BAMT) we have realized that people with need for Bayessian modeling sometimes don't know Python, so we 
decided to build web application in responce to this. We're following an idea to make application easy to use (with friendly-user interface), so we hope you will not face 
any trouble with Web-BAMT. Also if you're interested in key concept of bayessian learning, you should visit our Wiki page on GitHub.

# Future feature
1. Users' data (user will be able to upload his own datasets)
2. Improve comparison window (light the same edges, numerical comparison etc.)

# About Lab
Our laboratory is part of the National Center for Cognitive Technologies (ITMO University, Russia), which provides cutting-edge software and algorithmic solutions. 
We focus on natural systems simulations, generative design of real and virtual objects, data-driven modeling, automated machine learning.
